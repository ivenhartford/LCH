## Phase 1.7: Code Quality & Linting (Recommended - 1-2 days)

**Priority:** HIGH (before Phase 2)
**Status:** ⏭️ Recommended

While Phase 1 is functionally complete, adding linting and static analysis tools will improve code quality, consistency, and catch potential bugs early.

### Frontend Linting & Formatting
- ✅ **ESLint** - Already configured via create-react-app
- ⏭️ Add **Prettier** for consistent code formatting
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
  ```
- ⏭️ Create `.prettierrc` configuration
- ⏭️ Add pre-commit hooks with **husky** and **lint-staged**
- ⏭️ Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` scripts
- ⏭️ Fix existing linting warnings

### Backend Linting & Formatting
- ⏭️ Add **Black** for Python code formatting
  ```bash
  pip install black flake8 pylint
  ```
- ⏭️ Add **Flake8** for style guide enforcement
- ⏭️ Add **Pylint** for additional static analysis
- ⏭️ Add **mypy** for type checking (optional)
- ⏭️ Create `pyproject.toml` for tool configuration
- ⏭️ Add pre-commit hooks for Python
- ⏭️ Run `black .` and `flake8` on codebase

### Configuration Files
**Frontend** (`.prettierrc`):
```json
{
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "singleQuote": true,
  "printWidth": 100,
  "tabWidth": 2
}
```

**Backend** (`pyproject.toml`):
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py311']

[tool.flake8]
max-line-length = 100
extend-ignore = E203, W503

[tool.pylint]
max-line-length = 100
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Install **husky** for git hooks
- Configure **lint-staged** to run linters on staged files only
- Auto-format code before commit
- Block commits with linting errors

### Benefits
- Consistent code style across the team
- Catch potential bugs before runtime
- Easier code reviews
- Better editor/IDE integration
- Professional codebase quality

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days
**Impact:** High - Prevents technical debt accumulation

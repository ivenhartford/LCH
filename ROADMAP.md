2. ⚠️ Weak default SECRET_KEY - Session cookies can be forged

**High Severity Issues (4):**
3. No CSRF protection implemented
4. No rate limiting on any endpoints
5. Missing critical security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, etc.)
6. No CORS configuration

**Medium Severity Issues (4):**
7. Weak password policy (8 chars minimum, no complexity)
8. Inconsistent password hashing (bcrypt vs Werkzeug)
9. No email verification enforcement
10. Default database connection string fallback

**Low Severity Issues (4):**
11. Verbose error messages leaking implementation details
12. Sequential integer IDs (easy enumeration)
13. Staff accounts lack account lockout
14. Session cookie settings only secure in production

**Security Strengths:**
✅ SQL injection protection via SQLAlchemy ORM
✅ Passwords properly hashed (no plaintext)
✅ No hardcoded secrets or credentials
✅ Input validation via Marshmallow
✅ XSS prevention (no dangerous HTML rendering)
✅ Comprehensive audit logging
✅ HTTPOnly cookies enabled

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Database performance**: Mitigate with proper indexing and caching
- **Data migration**: Plan careful migration strategy if needed
- **Integration complexity**: Start with simple integrations, iterate

### Business Risks
- **Scope creep**: Stick to phased plan, defer nice-to-haves
- **User adoption**: Involve staff early, provide training
- **Compliance**: Consult HIPAA expert before launch

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular backups and testing
- Incremental rollout (pilot users first)
- Comprehensive testing before each phase
- User feedback loops throughout
